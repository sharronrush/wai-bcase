## Making the Business Case

For decades, accessibility advocates have promoted the idea of a “Business Case” for accessibility. This article defines terms, summarizes evidence, helps readers apply general perspectives to specific situations, and points to more in-depth research. Results validate the fact that accessibility is simply good business. 

Business Case is a term used to communicate the idea that there are sound business reasons for web accessibility beyond the humanitarian and compassionate cause of providing equal access to all people, regardless of abilities. The term is meant to persuade not only for-profit businesses but also government entities, non-profit organizations, schools and universities, and organizations of all types that there are solid business reasons to build and maintain web sites and applications that meet the needs of people with disabilities.  

While accessibility focuses on people with disabilities, numerous studies indicate that accessible design also improves the user experience for older users, mobile users, new users, people with low literacy, and several other groups. Broad benefits can therefore accrue for organizations that become adept at attracting and retaining larger market share by meeting a broad range of user needs.  

## Benefits of Web Accessibility
{:#benefits}

The many benefits of integrating accessible design and development in web sites and applications can be categorized into these four main topics:

### Social Benefits
The web is social. People all over the world are becoming more connected with each other. As more diverse people are connected, we all benefit. Numerous studies prove that companies prioritizing diversity and inclusion perform better financially.  While such studies generally focus on employee diversity, it is also true that companies openly embracing values of inclusion and that maintain a diverse workforce are more favorably viewed by wider groups of customers and vendors. Diversity means including people with disabilities and to do so companies must build and maintain web sites that are accessible to all. 

As we strive to meet diversity and inclusion goals, companies find that accessibility is good business. 

### Technical Benefits
The adoption of web standards has long been established as the most effective way to:
* achieve broad interoperability, 
* improve site quality, 
* reduce site development and maintenance time, 
* reduce server load, 
* enable content on varied platforms, and
* future-proof web properties for advances in web technologies. 

Accessibility standards are part of the network that makes such benefits possible.  Accessible Design anticipated the idea of Responsive Design – the notion of design practices that faithfully render content across varied platforms. 

Tech leaders know that for meeting broad technology demands, accessibility is good business.

### Financial Benefits
Industry leaders understand that baked-in accessibility is an innovation driver - enabling elegant solutions to unanticipated problems. Accessible design is by nature flexible, allowing content to be able to be faithfully rendered across a broad spectrum of devices, platforms, assistive technologies, and operating systems. A business with accessible web sites and applications increases market share by several million people with disabilities - a market that Fortune magazine estimates at $200 per year in the United States alone. Integration of accessibility into your company’s standard design, development, and QA processes minimizes development cost while maximizing market share. 

Financially, accessibility is good business.  

### Legal and policy benefits
The [UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities](http://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?navid=12&pid=150) explicitly references access to communications technology as a human right in the modern world. Since its adoption by the UN General Assembly in December of 2006 and subsequent ratification by more than 150 nations, the Convention has been a powerful influence on the global legal and policy landscape related to web accessibility. Companies around the globe are implementing the Convention through laws and government policies. In many countries, such laws extend beyond government sites and services to to inlcude mandates for businesses that offer goods and services on the web. 

To avoid legal risk, accessibility is good business. 

## It all adds up
These brief summaries only scratch the surface of the many ways that accessible design and development support an organization’s ability to increase markets, minimize costs, avoid legal risk, and support innovation.
